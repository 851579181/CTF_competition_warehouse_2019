After you solved all part 1,2,3,4,5,you will get an egg flag

the flag is N1EGG{sha256(part1'sflag+part2'sflag+part3'sflag+part4'sflag+part5'sflag)}

for example:

part1's flag is N1CTF{1}

part2's flag is N1CTF{2}

part3's flag is N1CTF{3}

part4's flag is N1CTF{4}

part5's flag is N1CTF{5}


the egg flag is N1EGG{sha256(12345)}
Have fun:)
