This is an easy hardware dongle which use UART(USB to TTL serial) to decrypt the encryption executable software.
The .zip archive contains two files, "target" is a ELF executable file of host computer and "dongle.bin" is the binary file which download to the slave device.
Note that slave device is STM32F103C8T6.
(Pay attension to memory mapping, instruction set and interrupt vector table of STM32F103)
